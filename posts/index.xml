      <description>Last time I wrote about going indie. It was sort of a 2022 in review since making a game was my main focus.
Tourist TrapLink to headingOur game, Tourist Trap, was released last November on Steam and Xbox. The plan was to release it in March but, surprise, it got delayed. Looking back I think it was clear we couldn&amp;rsquo;t make it to March but we didn&amp;rsquo;t want to accept it.</description>

      <description>Since the beginning of 2022 I&amp;rsquo;ve been working full time as an indie game developer. First of all, some background on myself.
The past 30th of December was my last day as a developer at Ironhide Game Studio. Almost ten years working on great games like the Kingdom Rush series, learning a lot not only as a programmer but in all areas of game development. Alongside Manuel we founded Tragico Media and are currently working on our first game Tourist Trap, a dark comedy point and click adventure.</description>
