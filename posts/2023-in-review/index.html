<p>Our game, Tourist Trap, was released last November on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2206660/Tourist_Trap/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/tourist-trap/9pmvdr1vcbb3">Xbox</a>.
The plan was to release it in March but, surprise, it got delayed. Looking back I think it was clear we couldn&rsquo;t make it to March but we didn&rsquo;t want to accept it.
We are really happy with how the game turned out. While it hasn&rsquo;t sold thousands of copies both players and game reviewers have enjoyed it and currently it has 52 reviews, 98% positive, on Steam.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who played it!</p>

<p>At the beginning of 2023 <a href="https://tragico.media">we</a> were notified we had won a goverment grant to develop a videogame prototype.
Late August was the deadline, so it was a bit rough with Tourist Trap&rsquo;s delay, but we managed to make a small game which we are happy with and want to improve further.
It&rsquo;s a narrative adventure set in South America and we&rsquo;ve been pitching it to potential partners.</p>

<p>In June I went to BIG Festival for the first time. It is a huge event and a lot of big publishers are there. This was my first experience pitching face to face so I was a bit nervous but I was alongside (Manu)[] which made things easier.
Met cool devs.</p>
<p>In September I was in Argentina for EVA. Last time I&rsquo;d been there was in 2017 and it is incredible how big the event is now. I went with my pals from Magical Beast Games who were showcasing their game Cleanup Crew.
After BIG I had an improved pitch deck and was really comfortable pitching by myself.</p>
<p>Overall both events were great experiences.</p>
<p>In October we had our local gamedev event, LevelUY. It&rsquo;s a tiny event compared to EVA but it is always fun to catch up with local devs. This year I went to a business workshop by Jason Della Rocca (spoilers: don&rsquo;t make narrative games). While a lot of the stuff said there was not new to me it was still a good learning experience.
There was a virtual pitching event organized by a government agency. This went great, as I had further improved our pitch deck after EVA and got a lot of positive feedback from other local devs on our pitch.</p>

<p>Release a game, even if it&rsquo;s &ldquo;just&rdquo; a jam game.
Further develop TragicoMedia&rsquo;s new prototype and try to get funding.
Develop small web games.</p>
